      <h2>🌻 About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Sakshi – the kind of developer who vibes with dark mode, 
        dreams in React components, and probably has 37 Chrome tabs open right now. 
        I love mixing tech + creativity – whether it's building AI tools, 
        debugging at 2AM, or just vibing to a good lo-fi playlist while coding 🎧.
      </p>

        Back in class 11, I chose IP (Informatics Practices) as a subject — and guess what? I was the **only girl** in that class. 💁‍♀️ It felt weird at first, but slowly, that weirdness turned into confidence.
      
        I didn’t grow up dreaming about writing code, but somewhere between random HTML tags and Python if-else loops — I found something I genuinely enjoyed.
      </p>

      <p>
        No, I didn’t clear JEE. And honestly? That used to break me. But what no one tells you is — **growth doesn’t always look glamorous**. Sometimes it’s messy, inconsistent, and filled with bugs (both in code and life 😅).
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, I’m still figuring things out. Still learning. Still evolving. And I’m okay with being a beautiful work-in-progress. ✨
